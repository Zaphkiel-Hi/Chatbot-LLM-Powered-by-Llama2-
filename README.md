# Chatbot-LLM-Powered-by-Llama2-
A Frontend Development of Data Extraction LLM Project. 
Sure, let's break down the code and explain each component for a comprehensive README on GitHub:

```python
import streamlit as st
import torch
from auto_gptq import AutoGPTQForCausalLM
from langchain import HuggingFacePipeline, PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFDirectoryLoader
from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceInstructEmbeddings
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from pdf2image import convert_from_path
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, TextStreamer, pipeline
import os
import gdown
```

### Streamlit
[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) is a Python library used for creating web applications with minimal effort. In this code, it's likely being used to create a web interface for some functionality.

### PyTorch
[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is an open-source machine learning library. It is used in the code, probably for some machine learning or deep learning tasks.

### AutoGPTQ
`AutoGPTQForCausalLM` seems to be a class or model related to natural language processing, possibly for generating text or answering questions.

### LangChain
[LangChain](https://github.com/jina-ai/langchain) is a library that provides a set of tools for working with natural language processing tasks. It includes components for text embeddings, document loading, and more.

- `HuggingFacePipeline`: Hugging Face provides pre-trained models and pipelines for natural language processing tasks. This component is likely using a pipeline from Hugging Face.
- `PromptTemplate`: This could be a utility for generating prompt templates in natural language tasks.
- `RetrievalQA`: A component for question-answering tasks with a focus on retrieval-based methods.

### PDF Handling
- `PyPDFDirectoryLoader`: A component for loading PDF documents from a directory.
- `pdf2image`: A library for converting PDF files to images, suggesting that there might be image processing involved.

### Hugging Face Transformers
[Hugging Face Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) is a popular library for working with state-of-the-art natural language processing models.

- `AutoTokenizer`: Automatically selects the appropriate tokenizer for a given pre-trained model.
- `TextStreamer`: A streaming interface for processing text data.

### Image Processing
`convert_from_path`: This function is from the `pdf2image` library and is likely used for converting PDF pages to images.

### Other Utilities
- `os`: Python's standard library for interacting with the operating system.
- `gdown`: A library for downloading files from Google Drive.

### Vector Stores
`Chroma`: A vector store for handling vector representations of text data.

### Summary
This code seems to be a combination of various libraries and tools for natural language processing, document handling (specifically PDFs), and web application development using Streamlit. It might be used for creating an interactive application for question-answering, text generation, or related tasks. The specific functionalities and use cases can be clarified by looking into the implementation details of each module or class.
